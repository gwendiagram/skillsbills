# Who?
The testers undertaking the training are {testers}. They will be getting mentored by {mentors}.
# What will they be learning?
They will be following the two courses below:

https://www.raywenderlich.com/949489-espresso-testing-and-screen-robots-getting-started
# Why?
Currently, we have {otherTesters} who are adept at iOS but in the testing discipline, we are missing skills in automating Android. In 1:1s with {testers}, they have both said that they want to grow their automation skills as a priority in their development. From a company perspective, really want to get Android acceptance tests and end to end tests automated, with tester skills, not only developer skills which we are currently relying on.
How they gonna have time for that?
We are specifying 2 hours a week for {testers} to run through the training.
# And if they have questions?
We have set up a slack channel, #learning-android where {testers} can put questions in, ready for their weekly mentoring session. The questions generally won't be answered in the slack channel, they will be answered in the mentoring session.

# What does this mentoring session entail?

The three mentors, {mentors} will be on a rotating rota where they spend half an hour to an hour a week running through any questions or issues they have had while learning through the week. Because {testers} are building apps, they can assist with any debugging, show them how to use Android Studio and teach them cool tips and tricks. It's difficult to get the concept of software architecture in a course, so mentoring on that would also be very valuable. By rotating the mentors, it means the mentors won't get tired, they will have the opportunity to mentor two people instead of one, therefore getting to work with different learning styles and the mentees will pick up more knowledge from a spread of people.

We will have a joined mentoring session where {testers} and two mentors attend. The session is on every {day} at {time} and runs between half an hour and an hour although an hour is booked. They have a meeting room booked.

The rota can be found here: {rota}

# How long will this run for?
The objective is set until the {date}. We can assess if longer if required.
# What are the actual objectives for {testers} for this?
So we all have an understanding of what we are setting out to achieve, the objectives set for {testers} are below:

**Build simple Android apps with guidance of a mentor and a video course**

Complete the Android and Kotlin for beginners video course https://www.raywenderlich.com/android/learn
In a Tester Gathering, show one of the apps created during the course and explain how the app works and what was needed to build the app

Work with an assigned developer mentor to gain an understanding of Android

**Apply knowledge gained from courses to build robots within the android-app codebase**

Complete the tasks specified in https://www.raywenderlich.com/949489-espresso-testing-and-screen-robots-getting-started

Pair with your assigned developer mentor to start building a robot in the espresso test framework in the android codebase

Work with your mentor to write acceptance tests for a feature that is not currently covered in the Android codebase

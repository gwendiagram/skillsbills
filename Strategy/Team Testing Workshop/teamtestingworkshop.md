# Team Testing Workshop

# Purpose
A workshop to identify with teams how they aim to tackle testing within their squad. Discussing and clarifying what testing means for the squad means that team members will all be on the same page and have a definition to point to when they integrate new members into their squad.

# Workshop goals:
* A clear definition of what testing the squad would like to cover

* A definition of the different layers of testing that the squad would like for their part of the product. For example, defining what a unit test, an integration test and an E2E test will look like for the squad.

* A diagram showing the kinds of testing that the squad would like to do (the diagram can be the planetary view of testing, the testing pyramid, the testing cone or something specifically designed by the team).

# Workshop agenda

10 mins - welcome and icebreaker

10 mins - A small retro on testing - what's working, what's not working, what could be better?

10 mins - defining what kind of testing currently exists within the squad, creating a rough diagram

10 mins - defining what testing layers should exist in the future

20 mins - defining what each layer of testing means for the squad, for example, for unit testing could be: Unit tests should cover isolated bits of code. If code is inherited from another class, do not test that class in the inheritance. Tests higher in the pyramid should cover this. Derived classes we are just testing changed code.

# What will come out of the session?
A page in {wiki} will be created for the team around testing which can be referred to. The testing layers will be clearly drawn out in {diagramTool} and the definitions will be attached.

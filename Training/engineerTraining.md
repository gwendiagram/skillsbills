# Who?
The engineers undertaking the training are {mentees}. They will be getting mentored by {mentors}.
# What will they be doing?
We would like {mentees} to pair with a {mentor} for an hour a week where they drive and the {mentor} navigates. This should expose the {mentees} to more ways to tackle problems at {company}. The pairing should be on services that aren't related to {menteesSquad} to expand {mentees} knowledge.
We would also like the mentors to be able to look over pull requests made by {mentees} to coach them and give feedback on their pull requests.

# What do the mentees want to learn out of this?

* All of the mentees have experience in {originalLanguage} and they would like to be able to think in a {newLanguage} native way instead of translating from {originalLanguage} to {newLanguage}.  

* They would like to have a deeper understanding of {newLanguage} fundamentals to enable themselves to build more complex services.

* They would like to pair on a complex service or piece of code that utilises {newLanguage} in ways beyond simple reads/writes and conditional expressions, especially concepts that don't directly map to {originalLanguage}.

* They would like to know more about why they should tackle problems in the way that we do - whether it is just the way that we work at {company} or if there is a deeper reason.

* They are interested in how they can tackle testing in {newLanguage}

* They would like someone that they can get advice from on meatier PRs, not meaning review all 40 changed files but to point to a piece of code and ask if there is a better way of doing it

# Why?
We have hired great {specialists} who are skilled in {originalLanguage} but their work is starting to incorporate more {newLanguage}. We would like the {specialists} to be comfortable with {newLanguage}, therefore, a mentoring scheme would assist them. A lot of work in the {menteeSquad} is now being done in {newLanguage}, an example is the {project}

# How are they gonna have time for that?
We will be specifying 1 hour a week for the pairing session to occur, and this will run for around 3 months. We will set a maximum of two pull requests a week sent to the mentor to ensure it doesn't take up too much time for the mentor.

# And if they have questions outside of the pairing time?
We will set up a slack channel, #{newLanguage}-mentoring where {mentees} can put questions in, ready for their weekly pairing session. The questions generally won't be answered in the slack channel, they will be answered in the mentoring session.
# How long will this run for?
We can run this as a one month trial, get feedback on how it is going
